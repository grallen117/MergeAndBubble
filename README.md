# MergeAndBubble

This program performs a bubbleSort and a mergeSort, by user choice. 
A struct is used in place of an array, as a dynamic size is decided
by user choice on how many numbers are used.
swapNumbers swaps the two numbers in the positions. This is because
of how bubbleSort works, swapping numbers from positions if one is greater
than the other.
bubbleSort does what was described above, using the swapNumbers function
to swap, and goes down the whole struct "array". 
NOTE : This program just does BubbleSort at the moment. Planning on adding
Merge Sort tomorrow.
